Project template for Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning and Python.

This project particularly aims to pinpoint certain Twitter accounts that spread hate and offensive language specifically directed at women, the LGBTQ community, and people of color. With the use of the Twitter Streaming API, the required twitter feeds would be collected with the support of a Python 3 backend. Our approach would specifically classify a particular tweet as offensive or as a hate speech, further subdividing it as a racist, sexist or homophobic tweet. Any specific tweet or a series of tweets could also belong to neither of the two above mentioned parent categories, creating eight distinct categories. Additionally, the implementation of the resources employed in the mechanism would thereby present a cumulative representation of the tweet demographic in percentage count.
